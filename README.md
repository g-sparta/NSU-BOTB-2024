# Oddball:The new normal
Submission for the 2024 HBCU Battle of the Brains.

## Description

Oddball: the new normal, is an add-on feature to the existing NFL+ subscription platform that incorporates a points reward system to drive subscriber engagement. Points can be accumulated through watching existing NFL+ content, particapting in AI/ML driven prediction polls, and partaking in different wellness activities; which can be redeemed for prizes. Subscribers are able to track their progress, the ability to watch NFL+ content for points, a chatbox that generates Athlete workouts, and the option to interact in-app with Play:60 and Madden 24. The generative AI component generates workouts from a large dataset comprised of NFL player workouts. The interactive polls in the app are generated by AI that has been trained using a Linear Regression model to predict what certain aspects of the game will be based on past in-season stats.
